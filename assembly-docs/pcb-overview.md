# PCB Overview

OSSM PCB source migration is in progress. The local PCB folder currently carries
the publication boundary and points to the upstream reference source until the
release PCB files are migrated.

| Asset | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PCB source folder | [`hardware/pcb/`](../hardware/pcb/) | Local OSSM PCB source boundary. |
| PCB migration notes | [`hardware/pcb/README.md`](../hardware/pcb/README.md) | Current status and upstream reference. |
| Upstream PCB files | [KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware](https://github.com/KinkyMakers/OSSM-hardware/tree/main/Hardware/PCB%20Files) | Reference until migration completes. |

No KiCad board file is present in `hardware/pcb/` yet, so Ohai does not render a
KiCanvas preview for OSSM.
